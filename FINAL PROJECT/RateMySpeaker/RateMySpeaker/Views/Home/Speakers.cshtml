                                Tim Cook took over for the late Steve Jobs as Apple's CEO in August 2011. Prior to that, Cook served as Apple's chief operating officer.
                                Born in Alabama on November 1, 1960, Tim Cook graduated from Auburn University with a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering in 1982, and went on to earn an M.B.A. from Duke University's Fuqua School of Business in the late '80s.

                                <strong>CEO, Yahoo!</strong><br />
                                Marissa Mayer led the development of Google's most successful products for more than 10 years and was appointed CEO of Yahoo in 2012, at the age of 37.
                                Although she grew up thinking she would be a doctor, while at Stanford University, Mayer developed a passion for computers and went on to earn both a Bachelor of Science in symbolic systems and an Master of Science in computer science, with a specialization in artificial intelligence. But it was perhaps her research internships at SRI International in Menlo Park, California, and the UBS research lab in Zurich that helped her net 14 job offers fresh out of grad school.
